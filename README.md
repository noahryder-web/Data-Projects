## Model Interpretation Techniques

### Model-Specific Techniques:

| Technique         | Description                                                             |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Linear Regression | Coefficients tell us the impact of each feature.                        |
| Logistic Regression | Coefficients and odds ratios reveal feature relationships.             |
| Decision Trees    | Feature importance and visualization of decision rules.                 |
| Tree Ensembles    | Aggregate feature importance across multiple trees.                     |

### Model-Agnostic Techniques:

| Technique                   | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Permutation Importance      | Shuffle and see what breaks!                                 |
| Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) | How features affect predictions on average.                 |
| Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) | See how individual predictions respond.             |
